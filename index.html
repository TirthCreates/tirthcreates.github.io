<p align="justify"><blockquote><font face="Gill Sans MT">
    Hi, I’m Tirth Parmar, a BCA student at GSFC University with a passion for technology, sports, and creativity. I’m deeply interested in gaming and graphic design, always eager to explore the latest trends and tools in the digital world. When I’m not immersed in my studies or designing, you’ll likely find me on the basketball court, swimming, playing cricket, or hitting the gym. I enjoy balancing my academic pursuits with staying active and constantly learning new things.

<blockquote><p align="justify"><font face="Gill Sans MT">
    In 11th grade, I become really interested in computers and technology. I enjoy using software, coding, and understanding how tech works. I start learning the basics of computers and programming. If my school offers computer science, I take it to get started.
 Outside of school, I use online resources to learn coding. Websites and apps help me practice programming languages like Python or Java.
I join or start tech clubs at school, participate in coding events, and maybe even organize tech-related activities.
I learn about BCA programs and what they require. If there’s an entrance exam, I practice with sample questions and take mock tests.
When I finish 12th grade, I apply to BCA colleges, showing off my projects and achievements.
Once I get into a BCA program, I’m excited to start learning more about computers and programming.
During my BCA studies, I stay motivated. I work on projects, internships, and keep exploring new areas in tech.</font><br>
