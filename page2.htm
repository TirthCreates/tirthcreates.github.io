<li><u>Graphics Designing:-</li></u>
<blockquote>

Graphic design has always been a passion of mine. From the first time I used Photoshop in high school, I was hooked. The ability to transform ideas into visual art and communicate messages through design is incredibly fulfilling.<br>
Graphic design captivates me because it blends creativity with problem-solving. Whether I’m designing a logo, a poster, or a website, I enjoy the challenge of making something visually appealing and functional. It’s like solving a puzzle where the pieces are colors, shapes, and typography.<br>
Working on design projects has been a significant part of my life. One of my favorite experiences was creating a branding package for a local business, which not only honed my skills but also gave me a sense of accomplishment. It was rewarding to see my designs come to life and make an impact.<br>
In the future, I hope to continue expanding my skills in graphic design, possibly exploring new areas like UX/UI design or motion graphics. I’m excited about the endless possibilities for creativity and innovation in this field.

<li><u>Photography:-</li></u>

<blockquote>
    Photography is more than just a hobby for me; it's a way to capture and preserve moments, tell stories, and express creativity. The art of freezing a moment in time and seeing the world through a lens has always fascinated me.<br>
    Photography captivates me because it allows me to see the beauty in everyday life and moments that might otherwise go unnoticed. The challenge of composing a shot, mastering lighting, and capturing the perfect image is both rewarding and fulfilling. Each photograph is a unique representation of a moment, a feeling, or a story, and I find joy in creating and sharing these visual narratives.<br>
    One of my favorite photography experiences was a trip, where I had the chance to capture sunrise over a landscape & documenting street life. Photography has also been a way for me to connect with others, whether it's through sharing my work online or collaborating on creative projects.<br>
    In the future, I hope to expand my skills by experimenting with new techniques and exploring different photography genres, such as portrait photography or wildlife photography. I’m excited about the potential to develop my own unique style and continue capturing the world through my lens.
